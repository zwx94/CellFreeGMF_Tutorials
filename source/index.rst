Abstract
========
Analyzing the cellular origins of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) and the changes occurring in these cells is crucial for advancing understanding of underlying disease molecular processes. Here, we propose CellFreeGMF, a tool that is designed to enable sample classification and diagnosis, identify cfRNA biomarkers and trace their cellular origins based on graph Matrix Factorization. Furthermore, by integrating cellâ€“cell communication analysis, CellFreeGMF investigates the functional alterations occurring in the source cells under disease conditions. We validate CellFreeGMF on diverse cell-free RNA transcriptome datasets. In the case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CellFreeGMF not only detected single-cell-resolved cfRNA biomarkers but also traced their cellular origins to myeloid and T-cell populations. Further analysis revealed significant transcriptomic differences in these cell populations between pathological and normal control groups. Our user-friendly toolkit, CellFreeGMF, along with its web-based Explorer (http://www.cellfreegmf.org/), enables tracing cfRNA biomarker cellular origins and elucidating pathophysiological changes in their source cells.
