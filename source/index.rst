Abstract
========
Understanding the cellular origins of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) and their alterations is essential for elucidating disease-related molecular processes. Here, we propose CellFreeGMF, a tool designed to enable diagnosis classification of samples, identify cfRNA biomarkers, and analyze the alterations in their originating cells based on graph matrix factorization. Furthermore, by utilizing cellâ€“cell communication analysis, CellFreeGMF investigates the functional alterations occurring in the cfRNA originating cells under disease conditions. We validate CellFreeGMF on diverse cell-free RNA transcriptome datasets. In the case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CellFreeGMF not only identified cfRNA biomarkers but also traced their cellular origins to myeloid and T-cell populations. Further analysis revealed significant transcriptomic differences in these cell populations between pathological and normal control groups. Our user-friendly toolkit, CellFreeGMF, enables identifying cfRNA biomarkers and elucidating pathophysiological changes in their source cells.\
